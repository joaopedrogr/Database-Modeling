# Database Modeling

Data modeling is essential for database design, ensuring efficient storage and accurate data retrieval. Normalization, a key aspect of data modeling, reduces redundancy and improves data integrity by organizing attributes and tables to minimize duplication and dependency.

The process involves several normal forms (NF). First Normal Form (1NF) ensures attributes contain atomic values, making records unique. Second Normal Form (2NF) requires 1NF compliance and full functional dependency on the primary key, eliminating partial dependency. Third Normal Form (3NF) builds on 2NF by removing transitive dependencies, ensuring attributes depend only on the primary key. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is stricter, requiring every determinant to be a candidate key. Fourth Normal Form (4NF) eliminates multi-valued dependencies, while Fifth Normal Form (5NF) ensures no loss of data in decomposed tables.

Normalization enhances database efficiency by reducing redundancy, improving data integrity, and simplifying maintenance. However, higher normal forms can introduce complexity and potential performance overheads, requiring designers to balance normalization benefits with practical application needs. By applying normalization principles, developers can create efficient, accurate, and scalable databases for modern applications.
